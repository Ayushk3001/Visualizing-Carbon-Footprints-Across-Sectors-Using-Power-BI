# Visualizing Carbon Footprints Across Sectors Using Power BI

## 🌍 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing carbon emissions data across various economic sectors using **Power BI**. The goal is to create interactive and insightful dashboards that reveal which sectors contribute the most to carbon footprints, helping drive data-informed climate decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand carbon emission patterns across sectors.
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard.
- Interpret trends to support climate-conscious strategies.
- Practice data modeling and visual storytelling with Power BI.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** – Data visualization and reporting
- **Microsoft Excel / CSV** – Raw data formatting
- **DAX** – For calculated columns and measures

## 🧪 Methodology
1. **Data Collection** – Acquired carbon footprint data segmented by sector and year.
2. **Preprocessing** – Cleaned and formatted the dataset in Excel.
3. **Power BI Modeling** – Loaded into Power BI and established relationships.
4. **Visualization** – Built dashboards using bar charts, pie charts, tree maps, and slicers.
5. **Insights** – Highlighted top-emitting sectors and their trends over time.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Despite the urgency of climate action, carbon emissions data is often underutilized or hard to interpret. This project provides a clear and accessible view of emissions by sector to support awareness and action.

## ✅ Solution
An intuitive Power BI dashboard that:
- Displays emissions by sector and time period.
- Allows filtering for deep-dive analysis.
- Highlights key contributors and trends.

## 📌 Conclusion
This Power BI project demonstrates the power of data storytelling in environmental analysis. By turning raw emission data into clear visuals, it aids in recognizing high-impact areas for improvement and encourages sustainability discussions.
